# Ionic React to-do list

Just a project I did for a shitty uni course. It's based off [this guide](https://medium.com/@benchedms/how-to-make-a-to-do-app-with-ionic-react-d92ece061284) and it uses [this free API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8858534/SW7dX7JG#97c7e1ce-0a37-4d6d-89af-aba8f34f1f4c) to simulate server interaction.
To run the app in your local enviroment:

1. Install the Ionic CLI: `npm install -g ionic@latest`
1. Clone the project.
1. Install dependencies: `npm i`.
1. Run the app with `ionic serve`.
